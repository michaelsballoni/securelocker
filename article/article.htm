Title:       securelocker: an httplite application for pretty good file storage security
Description: An exciting proof-of-concept that sews httplite with security components
Abstract:    In this article you will see how easy it is to write REST applications using httplite,
             and how off-the-shelf open source security components can combine to implement
             an interesting pretty secure file storage application

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This project shows how you can weave httplite REST APIs with
    off-the-shelf security components to build an interesting 
    pretty secure file storage application.
</p>

<h2>securelocker - pretty secure file storage</h2>
<p>
    The idea with securelocker is that we'd like to model a software system
    after the real world "applications" of items stored in lockers.
    You pay the fee, you get assigned a locker number, and you get a key to the locker,
    you put stuff in it, maybe you give the locker number and key to somebody else,
    or you just come back to get the stuff later.
    Important: The locker proprietor keeps a copy of the key you got, 
    and has a "sudo" key that can unlock any locker.  So it's pretty secure,
    as secure as you trust the locker outfit in general, and the person you got
    the key from in particular.
</p>
<p>
    So to model this in C++, I decided to write two applications.
</p>

<h3>securelockerd</h3>
<p>
    securelockerd is a command line application that serves as the locker outfit,
    and the operator of the application is the person running the business.
    The application takes commands to register, checkin, and checkout clients.
</p>

<h3>securelocker</h3>
<p>
    securelocker is another command line program where you can put, dir, get, and del
    files in the locker.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion and Points of Interest</h2>
<p>
    I hope you've seen how easy C++ REST API programming is with httplite,
    and how there are plenty of off-the-shelf security components that you
    can easily use to build pretty secure applications, like securelocker.
